Key Business Insights
Revenue Drivers: By identifying top-selling pizzas and peak ordering times, we can see which pizzas and order timings bring in the most revenue. This can help in prioritizing popular pizza types and optimizing promotional offers during peak hours.

Product Mix Optimization: The analysis reveals which pizza types, sizes, and categories are most popular and contribute the most to sales. This insight allows the business to streamline its menu, focus on best-sellers, and introduce similar items in popular categories.

Customer Preferences: The size analysis helps understand customer preferences, showing whether they prefer smaller, medium, or larger pizzas. This helps in optimizing ingredient purchases and marketing efforts.

Revenue Contribution by Category: The percentage contribution of each pizza type to the overall revenue shows which categories are performing well. It enables decisions on promoting underperforming categories or expanding high-performing ones.

Sales Trends Over Time: Cumulative revenue analysis over time can help in forecasting future sales and planning resources accordingly.



Potential Business Decisions

Promotions and Deals: Launch targeted promotions for top-selling pizzas or introduce combo deals during high-revenue hours.
